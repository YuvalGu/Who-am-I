# Who am I

This is our first assignment in WEB development:<br />
We created a website that help us intreduce ourselves with facts and pictures.<br />
Through the assigment we experienced html elements we learned in class, and we also used different types of css. <br />
This assigment was coded as WEB assignment on the 1nd semester of our 3st year Information Systems at College of Law & Business.<br />
